The steps that help achieve this are as follows:Step 1: Give weights (x,y) random values and then compute the error, also called Sum of Squares Error (SSE).Step 2: Compute the gradient or the change in SSE when you change the value of the weights (x,y) by a small amount. This step helps us identify the direction in which we must move x and y to minimize SSE.Step 3: Adjust the weights with the gradients for achieving optimal values for the minimal SSE.Step 4: Change the weights for predicting and calculating the new error.

How to handle an imbalance dataset?,"There are a number of ways to handle an imbalanced dataset, such as using different algorithms, weighting the classes, or oversampling the minority class.Algorithm selection: Some algorithms are better suited to handle imbalanced data than others. For example, decision trees and random forests tend to work well on imbalanced data, while algorithms like logistic regression or support vector machines may struggle.Class weighting: By assigning higher weights to the minority class, you can make the algorithm give more importance to it during training. This can help prevent the algorithm from always predicting the majority class.Oversampling: You can create synthetic samples of the minority class by randomly duplicating existing samples or generating new samples based on the existing ones. This can balance the class distribution and help the algorithm learn more about the minority class."
How do you solve the vanishing gradient problem in RNN?,"The vanishing gradient problem is a difficulty encountered when training artificial neural networks using gradient-based learning methods. This problem is resolved by replacing the activation function of the network. You can use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to solve the problem.It has three gates called input, forgets, and output gates. Here forget gates constantly observe what information needs to be dropped going through the network. In this way, we have short and long-term memory. So, we can transfer the information through the network and retrieve it even at the last stage to identify the context of prediction."
Explain the purpose of Sigmoid and Softmax functions.,"Sigmoid and softmax functions are used in classification problems. Sigmoid maps values to a range of 0-1, which is useful for binary classification problems. Softmax maps values to a range of 0-1 and also ensures that all values sum to 1, which is useful for multi-class classification problems."
Explain pragmatic analysis in NLP.,"Pragmatic analysis is a process of analyzing text data in order to determine the speaker's intention. This is useful in many applications, such as customer service and market research. Here, the main focus is always on what was said to reconsider what is intentionally driving the various aspects of language that require real-world knowledge. It helps you to discover this intentional effect by applying a set of rules that characterize cooperative dialogues. Basically, it means abstracting the meaningful use of language in situations."
What is the difference between collaborative and content-based filtering?,"Collaborative filtering is a method of making recommendations based on the likes and dislikes of a group of people, while Content-based filtering is a method of making recommendations based on the similarity of the content."
How is parsing achieved in NLP?,"Parsing is the process of breaking down a string of text into smaller pieces, or tokens. This can be done using a regex, or a more sophisticated tool like a parser combinator. There are various techniques for parsing in NLP, including rule-based approaches, statistical approaches, and machine learning-based approaches. Some common parsing algorithms include the Earley parser, the CYK parser, and the chart parser. These algorithms use various methods such as probability models, tree-based representations, and context-free grammars to parse a text and identify its grammatical structure."
What is Limited Memory? Explain with an example?,"A human brain learns from its experiences or from the past experiences it has in its memory. Just like the human brain, Limited Memory Artificial Intelligence learns from past data already in the memory and makes decisions on their behalf. But this data is stored for some specific time, and they cannot add it to their information center. Self-Driving is one of the best technology examples of Limited Memory AI. Self Driving cars can store data during driving, like how many vehicles are moving around them, vehicle speed, and the traffic lights. From their experiences, they understand how to drive properly on the road in heavy and moderate traffic. Few companies are focused on these types of technologies."
Describe the differences between stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and mini-batch gradient descent.,"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates the model's weights using the gradient calculated from a single training example. It converges faster because of frequent weight updates; however, it can have a noisy convergence due to high variance in gradients.Mini-batch gradient descent calculates the gradient using a small batch of training examples. It strikes a balance between the computational efficiency of batch gradient descent and the faster convergence of SGD. The noise in weight updates is reduced, leading to a more stable convergence."
How can you standardize data?,"Data standardization is a technique that is mostly performed as a preprocessing step of developing ML models to formalize the range of features of an input data set.Understanding data: You need to understand the distribution of your data to decide which standardization technique is appropriate. For example, if the data is normally distributed, you can use z-score normalization.Choosing standardization technique: Standardization techniques such as z-score normalization, min-max scaling, and mean normalization can be used depending on the type of data.Implementation: Standardizing data can be implemented using programming languages such as Python, and R, or tools such as Excel or a data automation platform.Impact on model performance: Standardization can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models. Hence, it's important to standardize the data before feeding it into the model"

How does information gain and entropy work in decision trees?,"Entropy is unpredictability in the data; the more uncertainty, the higher the entropy will be. Entropy is used by information gain to make decisions. If the entropy is fewer, the information will be big.Information gain is used in random forests and decision trees to decide the best split. Thus, the bigger the information gain, the better the split and the shorter the entropy.The entropy is used to calculate the information gain of a dataset before and after a split.Entropy is the calculation of the probability of suspense in the data. The main purpose is to reduce entropy and increase information gain. The feature having the maximum information is considered essential by the algorithm and is used for training the model."

Explain the use of kernel tricks?,"Kernel tricks are a technique used in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in machine learning algorithms, to transform a non-linearly separable problem into a linearly separable one. They are commonly used in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and other kernel-based algorithms for solving complex classification or regression tasks.The main idea behind kernel tricks is to map the input data from a lower-dimensional space to a higher-dimensional space, in which the data points become linearly separable. This mapping is done using a mathematical function called the kernel function."

The formula for the Score is:Score = Fraction of Income * (Fraction of Population + 2 * % of Population that is richer).Next, add all the terms in the â€˜Scoreâ€™ column. Let us call it â€˜Sum.â€™Using the formula calculate the Gini coefficient: = 1 â€“Sum."
