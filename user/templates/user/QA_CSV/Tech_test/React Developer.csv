Questions,Answers
What is React?,It is an open-source front-end JavaScript library most popular for single-page web applications. It is helpful when interactive and complex UIs are built for websites or mobile apps. React.js was released for use in 2015 and since then it has become one of the most trusted and used technologies of recent time. It has built one of the largest developer communities around itself.
List some of React.js’ features.,"Important features of React.js include:Instead of a real DOM, there is Virtual DOMIt completely renders the HTML files on the server into client HTML pages, in other words, server-side renderingIn React.js, the data can be passed to the other parts of an application only in one direction. In other words, there is a unidirectional flow of data."
What are the main advantages of React.js?,"The main advantages of React.js are:It enhances the performance of the applicationIt can be used from the client-side as well as the server-sideThe readability of code is higher in React.js because of JSXIt offers easy integration with frameworks such as Angular, Meteor, etc.It is easy to write UI test cases with React.jsIf you can include some practical experience demonstrating the advantages of React.js in this React.js interview question, you are likely to impress the recruiter."
What is JSX?,"JSX is the syntax extension for Javascript in React.js. With the help of JSX, it is easy to define how the user interface should look. Additionally, with JSX, the file containing the Javascript code can be used to write the HTML structures as well."
Describe an event in React.js?,"When a user presses a key, clicks the mouse, or performs any action on the machine or when the machine itself triggers an action, these actions are registered as events in React.js.In React.js, we use camelCase to name events, instead of the lowercase in HTMLIn React.js, because of JSX, a function is passed as an event handler, instead of the string in HTML"
How do Lists work in React.js?,"Lists in React.js are created similar to how they are created in regular Javascript. With lists, data can be displayed in an orderly manner and is useful in displaying menus on websites. For traversing lists, the map() function is used. For example,An array of numbers is taken by the map() function and their value is multiplied by 5var numbers = [2,4,6,8,10]const multiplyNums = numbers.map((number => {return (number*5);});console.log (multiplyNums);Output: The output in Javascript will be logged in the console. The output in the above case is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]"
Why are keys used in React.js Lists?,"Keys are used in React.js Lists because:Key helps in identifying what objects have been altered, moved, or deleted from listsWith the help of keys, it is easier to determine which objects must be re-rendered instead of all components being re-rendered all the time.React.js interview questions that ask about the use of a certain function or component in React.js programming are common."
Is HTML used in React?,"No, it uses an HTML-in JavaScript syntax called JSX (JavaScript and XML) that converts HTML tags to React elements."
Can you tell two downsides of React?,"It is difficult to integrate with an MVC framework like Rails. Also, users need to have the knowledge about integrating user interface into MVC framework."
Can you outline the differences between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?,Real DOM and Virtual DOM differ in following ways:

What exactly is the dispatcher?,It is the central hub of data flow in a Flux application that acts as a directory of callbacks.
Explain the callback function.,It is called when setState () has finished. A state can be updated in response to prop changes or server response using setState() method The main purpose is to prevent a component from re-rendering.
Explain React State.,"It is an object which stores the component’s property values. Also, it decides how the component renders and behaves."
Can a  State be updated in ReactJS?,"Yes, it can be updated directly or indirectly. To implement this one can use either this. setState function or the updater function."

How are ReactJS and React Native different?,"Where ReactJS is a front end open-source JavaScript library for UIs, React Native is an open-source mobile framework for platforms such as Android and iOS."
How do browsers read JSX files?,"As JSX is a combination of HTML and JavaScript, browsers are unable to read it. And hence a transpiler is needed to convert JSX to Javascript so that browsers can understand."
What is the most advised way for naming components?,By using reference rather than using displayName because it provides a clear and concise name for the component.
Mention one difference between Props and State.,State is mutable while Props are immutable. This means that the state is internal and managed by the component while props are external and managed by anything that renders the component.
What are pure components in ReactJS?,A React component is considered to be pure if it produces the same output when given the same set of state and props.

While it does not show any visible element in the development mode (does not impact the performance in the production mode as well), it does give warnings."
What is React Fiber?,It is the new reconciliation engine in React 16 and is used to enable incremental rendering of virtual DOM.
Can you differentiate between createElement and cloneElement?,"CreateElement creates a new element and returns it, while CloneElement clones an existing element and returns a new element."
Explain Lifting State Up in React.,"When multiple components need to share the same  data, it is advised to lift the shared state up to their parent. This means when two child components share the same data from their parent, the state is lifted up to the parent instead of the child components."
Explain stateful components.,"If the behavior of the component holds dependency on the state of the component, we term it as a stateful component."
"Tell me, how will you memoize a component in React?",We can memoize a component in React using memoization libraries.
How to use production mode in React?,It can be used through Webpack's DefinePlugin method to set NODE_ENV to production that takes out  propType validation and extra warnings.
Explain switching components.,"It is a component that renders one of many components. For this you need to use object to map prop values to components. Basically, it allows the user to turn the setting on or off."

How can you fetch data with React Hooks?,We can use useEffect that fetches the data through axios from the API.
What is Formik?,It is a third-party library that aids in form programming and validation.
Can you list some middleware choices for tackling asynchronous calls in Redux?,"Redux Promise, Redux Saga Redux Thunk"
Can browsers understand JSX code? Explain.,"No. A transpiler is needed to convert JSX to JavaScript. Web browsers are built to understand and read original JavaScript or JS objects. Since JSX is not a regular JS object, web browsers are unable to read it. For web browsers to read JSX, it must be made compatible by first converting it into regular JS objects. This is achieved by using a transcompiler, such as Babel. While this may seem like a simple ReactJS interview question, knowing answers to such questions can be critical."
What is one-way data flow in React?,React uses unidirectional data flow which means you can transfer data from parent to child and not the other way around.

What is prop drilling?,It is a situation where the same data is sent at every interdependent level until it reaches the final level.
What is virtual DOM?,"DOM is the abbreviated version of the Document Object Model. The DOM shows the logical tree structure for an HTML document. There is a node at the end of each tree branch, with every tree node containing one or more objects.In ReactJS, a lighter version of real DOM is stored in the memory. It is called the Virtual DOM. When there are any changes in specific objects, instead of updating all objects, only those specific changes are updated in the real DOM. This increases the efficiency and speed of the program. For a ReactJS interview question like this, if you have the opportunity to illustrate through a diagram, you must, as it shows the depth of your understanding."
Why do we use keys in Lists?,"The main reason why we use keys in lists are as followsIt is an identifier to find which items have changed, updated, or deleted from listsFind out which items need to be re-rendered"
Explain React forms?,"React forms allow users to interact with web applications. They help users to enter the information when required. They contain buttons, text fields, checkboxes, etc."
What are the components in React?,"In a React application, they are independent and reusable bits of code that can be processed separately. A single app may therefore contain multiple components."
