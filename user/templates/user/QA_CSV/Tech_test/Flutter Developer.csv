Questions,Answers
Why is Flutter preferred over other mobile app developing tools?,"Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework, introduced by Google in May 2017. Flutter enables you to develop a native mobile app using only one codebase. This implies you may design two separate apps using the same programming language and codebase (for iOS and Android).Flutter is preferred over other mobile app development tools like Java and React Native due to a myriad of reasons. A few of them are:Flutter supports cross-platform developmentProgramming in Flutter is extremely easy and flexibleThe building process in Flutter is much faster than that in all its competitors"
What are packages and plugins in Flutter?,"A package is a set of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages that allow users to create modular code that can be shared easily. Instead of starting from scratch, using packages can help construct applications fast. In Flutter, you may use a package to add new widgets or functionality to an app.On the other hand, a plugin is a piece of software that enhances your app's functionality. Plugins play a crucial role in the Flutter ecosystem."
What are the limitations of Flutter?,"Since Flutter is still a relatively new tool, it has some limitations. They are as follows:The number of third-party libraries is very smallThe release size of Flutter is larger than expectedFlutter requires to be used along with another OOP language, Dart which cannot compete with other OOP languages such as Java, C#Due to Flutter’s limited complexity, mobile ad platforms do not support itFlutter is still not used by a wide audience"
Why does it generally take a long time to develop a Flutter app?,"Because Flutter generates a device-specific IPA or APK file, building a Flutter application takes substantially longer the first time. This method, which normally takes a long time, uses Xcode and Gradle to build a file."
What are keys and how do you use them?,"A set of IDs for Widgets, Elements and SemanticsNodes make up the key class. Keys are responsible for preserving the state of widgets when they are updated inside the widget tree. Keys may also be used to modify and rearrange collections of widgets of the same type and defined states.Otherwise, keys may be superfluous to the code, even if they aren't harmful in any manner. Keys are useful when you need to edit a widget tree with stateful widgets, but not when the tree is entirely made up of stateless widgets."
What are the different types of streams in Dart?,"Streams provide an asynchronous sequence of data. Asynchronous programming uses the idea of streams. They refer to a program's asynchronous succession of data occurrences. We put a value on one end and a listener on the other, similar to a pipe. Several listeners can be combined into a single stream, and when they are placed in the pipeline, they will all get the same data. It is possible to utilize the SteamController to establish new streams or manage existing ones. There are two types of streams:Single Subscription StreamsThese streams convey events in chronological order. They're thought of as individual sequences inside a greater totality. When the sequence in which events are received matters, such as when reading a file, these streams are employed. Throughout the sequence, there can only be one listener, and the event will not be triggered if there isn't one.Broadcast StreamsThese broadcasts provide subscribers with information about upcoming events. Subscribers can instantly begin listening to events after subscribing to them. These are flexible streams that allow several listeners to listen at the same time. Furthermore, even after canceling a previous membership, one may listen again."
What is pubspec.yaml file?,"While creating a Flutter project, a particular type of file is always included at the top of the project. This file is known as the pubspec.yaml file, also called ‘pubspec’. This file contains information about a project's dependencies, such as packages and their versions, typefaces, and so on. It ensures that the package version is the same the next time you create the project. You can also place restrictions on the app. This project's configuration file will be used a lot while working with the Flutter project. This specification is written in YAML, a human-readable markup language."

Can you explain how to use the Provider package for state management in Flutter?,"The Provider package is a state management library that allows you to share data between widgets efficiently. You can use the Provider package to create a data model, expose it using a provider, and then access it in your widgets using the Provider.of method."
What is the difference between Expanded and Flexible?,"Flexible takes the least space needed to fit in a child widget. On the other hand, expanded takes the rest of the size in the widget."
Can you tell us some differences between const and final in Flutter?,The only difference between const and final is that the const variables are evaluated at compile-time and are immutable whereas final variables are evaluated at runtime and can only be set once.
How would you optimize the performance of a Flutter app?,"Some techniques to optimize the performance of a Flutter app include using the const keyword to make widgets immutable, avoiding unnecessary widget rebuilds, using the Provider package for efficient state management, and minimizing the number of expensive operations in the build method.So, if your app is small, you can pass your data using the constructor of the widget class, but for a larger app, this is not an easy task. Unknowingly we use inherited widgets in many places while developing the flutter app.Theme.of(context), Navigator.of(context), and MediQuery.of(context)."
Can you describe how to implement internationalization in a Flutter app?,"Flutter provides the Intl package, which allows you to add support for multiple languages to your app. You can use the package to define messages in different languages, format numbers, dates, and times, and apply pluralization rules based on the language."
Differentiate between setState and Provider?,"The setState() is used for managing the local state. Calling the setState() function notifies the framework about the change in the state of the object and that may affect the user interaction in the subtree.Whereas, provider is a state management technique in Flutter that allows widgets to access data from a central location (i.e., a ""provider""). Providers can be used to manage the application state, such as user authentication or data fetched from an API."
Is it possible to nest a Scaffold? Why or why not?,"Yes, it is possible. Scaffold is a widget, so you can put it anywhere you want. Scaffold provides APIs like Drawer, SnackBar, BottomNavigationBar, FloatingActionButton, etc. However, it is not necessary to nest scaffolds as they can be used on their own."
"Can you explain how to use streams and futures in Flutter? Also, tell us some similarities and differences between Future and Stream?","Streams and futures are powerful tools for handling asynchronous operations in Flutter. You can use a stream to listen for a series of events, such as user input or network responses, and react to them in real-time. A future, on the other hand, represents a value that may not be available yet and allows you to execute asynchronous code and retrieve the result when it's ready.Similarities between future and stream:Both work asynchronouslyBoth have some potential valueDifferences between future and stream:Future has one response whereas a stream can have multiple responses.Futures are used in HTTP calls.A Stream is a series of futures."
Can you tell us the difference between WidgetsApp and MaterialApp?,"The main difference between WidgetsApp and MaterialApp is that the widget offers basic navigation, whereas MaterialApp is built on top of WidgetsApp."
Can you state some difference between runApp() and main()?,Main(): Main() function starts the program. You cannot write a program in Flutter without using the main() function whereas runApp() is used to launch the software. RunApp() allows you to return the widgets that are connected to the screen as the widget tree’s root.
What’s the need of mixins?,"Multiple inheritances are not supported in Dart. Hence, you would need mixins to use multiple inheritance in Flutter, as they allow you to write reusable class code in multiple class hierarchies."
Flutter Vs React: Which is better?,"It's difficult to decide which framework to choose as they both are exceptionally good and loved by companies and developers. However, you can pick one based on your particular needs."
Why do we need separate directories for iOS and Android in Flutter?,"Here’s why you would need two different directories for Android and iOS files in Flutter:Android Folder: You need an Android folder to keep files of an Android project. When any Flutter framework creates the code, the compiler converts the Flutter code into native code that is then imported to Android projects creating a native Android app.iOS: This stores all the files for Mac projects. If you’re creating a project for the iOS platform, the iOS folder will be used. iOS apps can only be developed using the Xcode IDE and macOS in Flutter, which is why you’d need the iOS folder."
Can you explain how to use Flutter's built-in navigation system to create a multi-level navigation hierarchy?,Flutter's navigation system allows you to create a multi-level navigation hierarchy by using the Navigator widget to manage a stack of pages. You can push new pages onto the stack using the Navigator.push method and remove them using the Navigator.pop method
Can you describe how to use Flutter's gesture recognition system to detect user input?,"Flutter's gesture recognition system provides a set of pre-defined gestures, such as tap, drag, and scale, that allow you to detect user input and react to it. You can use the GestureDetector widget to listen for gestures and the GestureDetector.onTap method to handle taps. You can also create custom gestures by subclassing the GestureRecognizer class."
"How would you create a custom widget in Flutter, and what are the benefits of doing so?","To create a custom widget in Flutter, you need to create a new class that extends either StatefulWidget or StatelessWidget, depending on whether your widget needs to be stateful or not. The benefits of creating custom widgets include reusability, encapsulation of complex logic, and improved code organization.Example code:"
What is the difference between hot reload and hot restart?,"In Flutter, Hot Reload is the easiest and quickest way to  make any changes, create UIs, fix bugs, and add features to the app. A Hot Reload performs all these changes rapidly and makes changes in the UI without disturbing the entire app.Here’s how to perform Hot Reload:Run the Flutter editor using command prompt or editor.Once the project is created, you can use debug mode and perform hot reloadIn windows, use “ctrl+\” to perform hot reload or using the button. For Mac devices, you can use “cmd+s” to perform hot reload. If you’re using the command prompt enter ‘r’ to run.A Hot Restart is different from Hot Reload as it demolishes the preserved states of the app and compiles the code from scratch.Hot Restart takes more time as compared to Hot Reload but takes less time than restart function.Here’s how to perform Hot Restart:Run the editor using command promptMake some changes and run the hot restartTo start hot restart use the hot reload button or press ctrl+shift+."
Can you describe how to use the Flutter animations API to create custom animations?,"The Flutter animations API provides a set of classes and widgets that allow you to create custom animations, such as tween animations or physics-based animations. You can use the AnimationController class to manage the animation's state, and the Tween class to define the animation's values over time."
Can you describe in detail the Flutter IDEs?,"Some of the most popular Flutter IDEs include the following:IntelliJ IDEA is feature-rich, boasts extensive support for many languages, and provides smart coding assistance. Most beginner developers would probably get by with the free Community Edition, but the paid Ultimate Edition is required to access additional features.Android Studio works like IntelliJ IDEA but for Android only. Unlike the latter, though, Android studio is free and open-source. With smart coding assistance and a built-in debugger, it seems the best choice when programming for Android devices.Visual Studio code, or simply VS Code, is a free tool backed by Microsoft. It speeds up development and lowers development time. It works with Windows, macOS, and Linux.As this is one of the most critical Flutter interview questions to guage a developer’s knowledge, you can also ask what their favorite IDE is and their justification for picking one."
How do you implement a custom transition between screens in Flutter?,"To implement a custom transition between screens, you can use the PageRouteBuilder class and provide a custom transitionBuilder function.For example, to create a fade transition:Then, to use the custom transition, you can simply push the new route:Navigator.of(context).push(FadeRoute(page: MyNewPage()));"
How do you implement a draggable widget in Flutter?,"To implement a draggable widget in Flutter, you can use the Draggable and DragTarget widgets. For example, to create a draggable widget that can be dropped onto a specific target:"
How do you implement a custom animation curve in Flutter?,"To implement a custom animation curve in Flutter, you can create a class that extends the Curve class and provide a custom implementation of the transform method. Here is an example of how to create a bounce-in curve:In the transform method, you can use any mathematical formula to create a custom curve. In this example, we're using a mathematical formula that simulates a bounce-in effect.Then, to use the custom curve in an animation, you can simply pass it to the curve property of the Tween class:In this example, we're using the BounceInCurve as the curve property of the CurvedAnimation widget, which is then passed to the parent property of the Tween widget. This will create an animation with the bounce-in effect."
